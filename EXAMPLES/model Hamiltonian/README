For the example Hamiltonian used in lanczos.f90, all spectra are calculated with eta = 0.1 and the spectral range is set by the variable spect_range which is 22 in all cases. 
200 Lanczos iterations are used for all the iterative solutions.

In realistic Hamiltonians that are non-Hermitian, the Lanczos coefficients obtained with the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm and its 
variants are generally complex, and have non-zero imaginary part. In this case, one sets eta = 0.0 when calcualting the spectrum.

The simplicity of the model Hamiltonian used means that all algorithms give almost the same spectrum as the exactly calculated spectrum.

The loss of orthogonality/biorthogonality calculated via the Frobenius norm of the matrix is saved in fnorm_***.dat.

The files resolvent_***.dat contain the dielectric function.

orthinfo_***.dat gives information about the PRBO strategies.

lanc_coeffs_***.dat contain the Lanczos coefficients for the different algorithms.
