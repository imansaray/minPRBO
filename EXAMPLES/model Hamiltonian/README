## For the example Hamiltonian used in lanczos.f90, all spectra are calculated with eta = 0.1 and the spectral range is set by the variable spect_range. 

## In realistic Hamiltonians that are non-Hermitian, the Lanczos coefficients obtained with the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm and its 
variants are generally complex, and have non-zero imaginary part. In this case, one sets eta = 0.0 when calcualting the spectrum.

## The simplicity of the model Hamiltonian used means that all algorithms give almost the same spectrum as the exactly calculated spectrum.
