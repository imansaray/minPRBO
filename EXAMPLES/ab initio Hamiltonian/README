The data files included here correspond to those used for the plots in the paper.

Notation: 
         gam - the constant, small imaginary number added in the Hermitian spectrum calculation and for GMRES
         scal - the scaling factor for the imaginary energies added to form the complex energy Hamiltonian
         niter - the number of Lanczos iterations
         TDA - Tamm Dancoff approximation
         b - flag to turn the "bubbles" part of electron-hole interaction on and off
         l - flag to turn the "ladder" part of electron-hole interaction on and off
         FBSE - full BSE, the GMRES spectra within the full BSE matches with the TDA spectra from the Lanczos algorithm only at the IPA, i.e., b = 0, l=0.
                With full interaction turned on (b=1,l=1),the coupling blocks in the FBSE include additional physics thats ignored when one does just TDA.

File names
         f_*** - corresponds to the Loss of orthogonality calculated from the Frobenius norm of the matrix.
         opcons_*** - contains the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. 
                      For GMRES, contains energy, e1,e2 (see serial code section).
                      For Lanczos, contains energy, e1,e2 and other constants (see header in e.g file).
         diff_*** - contains the difference between two spectra specified in file name.
         orthinfo_*** - contains rebiorthogonalization information from minprbo.
         orth_lev_*** - contains the level of biorthogonality at each iteration, a local measure of the biorthogonality amongst Lanczos vectors (see paper for method of calculation).
         im_a_*** - imaginary part of the Lanczos coefficient a/alpha
         herm - hermitian
