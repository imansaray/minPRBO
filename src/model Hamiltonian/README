lanczos.f90 contains implementation of the Hermitian Lanczos algorithm with no reorthogonalization and full reorthogonalization, and an implementation of the non symmetric Lanczos algorithm (for real matrices),
and the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm for complex non-Hermitian matrices. 

It carries out full, partial rebiorthogonalization as initially described in the literature, and minimal partial rebiorthogonalization that we propose for solid state non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
