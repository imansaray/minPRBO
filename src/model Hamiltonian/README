lanczos.f90 contains implementation of the Hermitian Lanczos algorithm with no reorthogonalization and full reorthogonalization, 
an implementation of the non symmetric Lanczos algorithm (for real matrices), and the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm for complex non-Hermitian matrices. 

It carries out full, partial rebiorthogonalization as initially described in the literature, and minimal partial rebiorthogonalization that we propose for solid state non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

When carrying out reorthogonalization or rebiorthogonalization, there are different ways of carrying out the Gram-Schmidt process with varying costs and stability. Different options are implemented in the code.

A simple model Hamiltonian is included to test the routines. A user can define or input their own Hamiltonian. 

The motivation for minPRBO was non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in the context of solid-state systems. 
These tend to have a narrow spectral range, and as such minPRBO will work well for model Hamiltonians of a similar nature.
