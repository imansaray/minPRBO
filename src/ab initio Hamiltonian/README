The ab initio Hamiltonian used as an example is for silicon, with 24 bands, 16^3 k points. The relevant ab initio data 
is obtained with OCEAN (https://github.com/times-software/OCEAN/) with input file Si.in, and pseudo-potential file si.fhi.UPF from PseudoDojo.  

Codes based on AI2NBSE (https://github.com/feffgroup/AI2NBSE) are used to carry out the calculation of the dielectric function.

The ab initio data is processed into intermediate data files that are needed for running the main codes. 


                                               MAIN PROGRAMS 

     serial code
          smnewma.f90 : the Hermitian Lanczos algorithm and GMRES are implemented in smnewma.f90. Each case
               is selected with 'hay' for Hermitian Lanczos, 'inv' for GMRES that is set in the code with the
                variable 'meth'.

          smnewma_nherm.f90 : this implements the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm with the different variants
                 minimal partial rebiorthogonalization (minPRBO), partial rebiorthogonalization (PRBO) 1 and 2.
                 These options can be set by choosing the respective subroutine in the code.

          spectrum.f : used to calculate the complex dielectric function and other derived quantities from the Hermitian Lanczos 
                       coefficients (all real numbers) obtained from smnewma.f90. The dielectric function from the GMRES calculation is
                       written to file at the end of the GMRES calculation. The name of the file can be set in smnewma.f90.

          zspectrum.f : used to calculate the complex dielectric function and other derived quantities from the non-Hermitian Lanczos 
                       coefficients (complex numbers) obtained from smnewma.f90.
     parallel code
          psmnewma_nherm_minprbo.f90 : a parallel implementation of minPRBO which produces the non-Hermitian Lanczos coefficients
                       that can be used with zspectrum.f to obtain the optical quantities. 


                                           INPUT FILES TO EDIT FOR DOING RUNS

niter.h : this contains options for the number of Lanczos iterations, different flags to turn on/off parts of the electron hole interaction, 
quasiparticle corrections, a full BSE calculation and whether a non Hermitian Hamiltonian is been used
         niter - the number of Lanczos iterations
         bflag - to turn on/off the "bubbles"/exchange part of BSE interaction kernel
         lflag - to turn on/off the "ladders"/direct part of the BSE interaction kernel
         backf - to turn on/off time reversal symmetry
         aldaf -  for including time-dependent LDA
         qpflg - for correcting DFT energies 
         bwflg - to include backwards going pairs for full BSE
         bande - for including one-electron band-energy differences for an exciton
         nonhe - to do a non-Hermitian Lanczos tridiagonalization

*** ALL RUNS ARE DONE WITHIN THE TAMM-DANCOFF APPROXIMATION (TDA), WITH QUASIPARTICLE CORRECTIONS DONE BY THE 'SCISSORS' METHOD. HENCE backf = aldaf = bwflg = 0, qpflg = 1 FOR ALL RUNS. ***

ortho_flag : 
           biortho - to decide whether to do any rebiorthogonalizations
           full - carrying out full rebiorthogonalization or minprbo or other variants.

gmres_in :  file to set the parameters for the GMRES calculations done with smnewma.f90
         nloop - number of loops for the restarted GMRES
         gres -  small imaginary broadening added
         gprc - preconditioning factor
         f(1) - tolerance for the residual
         ener - starting energy value
         de - energy step
         emax - maximum energy value

scal_ze : sets the value of sigma, the scaling factor for the complex energy added to the one-particle energy differences

spect.ipt : contains parameters for calculating the dielectric function and other quantities with
            spectrum.f (Hermitian Lanczos, real coefficients), zspectrum.f (Non-Hermtian Lanczos, complex coefficients)
           gam - small, constant imaginary broadening, same as gres for the GMRES runs
           el - lower bound of the energy
           eh - upper bound of the energy range
           ne - number of energy ponts
           niter - numer of Lanczos iterations

Specifically for parallel code

block.in : for the parallel code psmnewma_nherm_minprbo.f90. This sets the block sizes for partitioning
           of matrices used in rebiorthogonalization carried out in parallel with scaLAPACK.
           Contains the integers: block_size_thresh, block_size_opt, block_size_m
           block_size_thresh - the number of Lanczos iterations is compared to this threshold to determine
                               how the columns of the matrix are divided.
           block_size_opt - the number of columns depends on the Lanczos iteration, this is used to set a reasonable value.
           block_size_m - integer to split up the number of rows of the Hamiltonian amongst processors.
