The ab initio Hamiltonian used as an example is for silicon, with 24 bands, 16^3 k points. The relevant ab initio data is obtained with OCEAN, and a serial code based on the NBSE code is used to carry out the calculation of the 
dielectric function.

Input files to edit for doing runs:

niter.h : this contains options for the number of Lanczos iterations, different flags to turn on/off parts of the elctron hole interaction, quasiparticle corrections, a full BSE calculation and whether a non Hermitian 
Hamiltonian is been used
         niter - the number of Lanczos iterations
         bflag - to turn on/off the "bubbles"/exchange part of BSE interaction kernel
         lflag - to turn on/off the "ladders"/direct part of the BSE interaction kernel
         backf - to turn on/off time reversal symmetry
         aldaf -  for including time-dependent LDA
         qpflg - for correcting DFT energies 
         bwflg - to include backwards going pairs for full BSE
         bande - for including one-electron band-energy differences for an exciton
         nonhe - to do a non-Hermitian Lanczos tridiagonalization

ortho_flag : 
           biortho - to decide whether to do any rebiorthogonalization
           full - and full or minprbo or other variants.

gmres_in :  file to set the parameters for the GMRES calculations done with smnewma.f90
         nloop - number of loops for this restarted GMRES
         gres -  small imaginary broadening added
         gprc - preconditioning factor
         f(1) - tolerance for the residual
         ener - starting energy value
         de - energy step
         emax - maximum energy value

scal_ze : sets the value of sigma, the factor for the complex energy
