This is a series of instructions for how to obtain the ab initio data from an OCEAN run to use with the serial codes provided.
It assumes that OCEAN (https://github.com/times-software/OCEAN/) is already installed. 

*** To enable saving of the data files required for running the serial codes, in the file /OCEAN/PREP/src/prep_wvfn.f90 there is a 
'wantLegacy' flag that should be set to 'true' before the executables are generated. ***

1. Complete an OCEAN run (lets call this 'ocean_run_dir') within the TDA, using the provided input file, and pseudopotential file.

2. Go into the 'ocean_run_dir/DFT' folder. There will be two folders
with the input kpts (16 by 16 by 16), but differnt q. Go into the folder with the rational q values.

3. In the 'Out' directory, there will be a 'system.save' directory containing the wave function files
from Quantum Espresso. 

4. Copy the 'system.save' directory into the directory where you want to run the serial code from (lets call this 'serial_run_dir').

5. Go to ocean_run_dir/PREP/BSE, and copy the following files into the serial_run_dir: 
       QE_EIGS.txt, QE_EIGS_shift.txt, qinunitsofbvectors.ipt,avecsinbohr.ipt,efermiinrydberg.ipt,
       brange.ipt,kmesh.ipt,tmels.

6. Go to ocean_run_dir/CNBSE and copy these to serial_run_dir:
       ptmels.dat,rhoofr,rho2.xpts,bvecs,gap,val.u2.dat,con.u2.dat,decut.

7. Check the parameters in datagen.f90 and makes sure they match that in Si.in.

8. Run prep.bash to generate the necessary input files using the OCEAN data.

9. After prep.bash completes succesfully, go to ocean_run_dir/PREP/BSE and copy again the following files
   into serial_run_dir:
       u2.dat,ptmels.dat,tmels.

10. Once all the intermediate data and input files are successfully generated, you can now run the main
    programs following the description in the README file.
